## My process

I started with the markup layout for the design using HTML attributes for structure.

Created an external CSS file for styling the HTML and linked it with the index.html page

Styled the body and the attribute that needed to be styled and finally wrote the styles for mobile and desktop view to ensure that the content is responsive and meets WCAG requirements by testing the full range of screen sizes from 320px to large screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had fun while i was doing this challenge, it helped me become more confident in my skills that i am a preety good web developer.

### Continued development

I will still continue learning more about Responsive design because this challenge made me understand my lapses and areas i need to improve.
